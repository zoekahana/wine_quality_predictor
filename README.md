# wine_quality_predictor
A data science/machine learning project which can predict a wine's quality given its other features.

This project was made by modifying the tutorial at https://medium.freecodecamp.org/using-machine-learning-to-predict-the-quality-of-wines-9e2e13d7480d. Medium provided supplementary data visualization code, visuals.py, which I used in my implementation.

The wine dataset is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository at this link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality. Additional citations can be found at the beginning of my writeup.
